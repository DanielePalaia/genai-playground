A simple project to experiment with llm models, prompts, langchain, RAG, chromaDB and in general on how to test this kind of applications

The project aims to be a chatbot replying technical questions for some OSS products (Gemfire, Greenplum, RabbitMQ).

The project is updating the kowledge of the model using RAG (with ChromaDB) collecting some info from the web and updating the model.

The project is using ollama in order to load a orca-mini model running locally.

Probably in the future I will experiment with langgraph and huggingface too.
